## 📌 Overview

Car Price Prediction is a machine learning project that predicts the **selling price of a car** based on various features such as brand, year, fuel type, transmission, mileage, and more. This project demonstrates the practical use of **supervised learning (regression)** techniques in real-world scenarios.

The goal is to help users, sellers, and buyers estimate a fair car price using data-driven insights.

* **Algorithm Used:** Linear Regression
* **Target Variable:** Car Price
* **Features:**

  * Car Name / Brand
  * Year of Purchase
  * Present Price
  * Kilometers Driven
  * Fuel Type
  * Seller Type
  * Transmission Type
  * Number of Owners

---
